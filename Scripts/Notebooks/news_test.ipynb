EDT\n","\t     \n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm just prepared to take \n","questions today.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton \n","administration's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the \n","United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that \n","the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, President Clinton has \n","said that that suggestion is under active consideration.  Obviously, \n","this is a tragic situation in Bosnia.  And if the Bosnian Serbs don't \n","come to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we'll look \n","seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo.  In the meantime, \n","we're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in \n","the U.N.  We're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the \n","negotiating table.  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something \n","the President certainly will consider if the Serbs don't come to the \n","table.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  How much longer are you going to give them to come \n","to the table, George?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on that right now.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  It's been a long time.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  On February 19th, the President mentioned the value \n","added tax in Ohio.  And when he was asked about it later by \n","reporters, he said -- quote -- \"That is a radical change in the tax \n","system of the United States.  It's something I think we may have to \n","look at in the years ahead.\"  Questioned again about it later he \n","says, \"It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we \n","start considering it, I'll tell you.\"  It wasn't a trial balloon or \n","anything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a \n","question.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote -\n","- \"Certainly we're looking at a VAT.\"  What's gone on?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The same with Alice Rivlin this morning.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is \n","reviewing a number of options.  They haven't made any decisions yet.  \n","And as I have said from this podium time and time again, we're not \n","going to comment on decisions that haven't been made.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But you have also said from this podium time and \n","time again --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     that that was not under consideration.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Yes.  Clinton says, \"It is not something that is \n","now under consideration.\"  Is that no longer true?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms. \n","Shalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been \n","made of any kind.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Well, I know.  But he said he'd tell us about it if \n","it was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he \n","didn't tell us about it or --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under \n","consideration or if it was something to be proposed?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  \"If we start considering I'll tell you.\"\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it's something to be proposed?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  \"If we start considering it, I'll tell you.\"  \n","That's a direct quote.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a \n","number of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.  \n","The President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the \n","proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and \n","cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform \n","the health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have \n","looked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of \n","different proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Well, is the President aware of their consideration \n","of this option?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he's been briefed \n","on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task \n","force on this specific proposal of any kind.  I don't know that \n","that's gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with \n","the task force a very wide range of decisions and I don't believe \n","that that's been presented to him, no.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Well, he's not relying on the USA Today to tell him \n","what his task force is considering in the way of taxes.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he's going through it in a very \n","deliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be \n","made.  I don't know that this proposal has reached that decision-\n","making point.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  If this is still under consideration, that's a \n","change, at least from what we've been told by Dee Dee, I think about \n","three weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking \n","about the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I \n","remember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that \n","not the case?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if this has \n","been presented to the President as something that is being looked at \n","at some level in the task force.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other \n","options that you've kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled \n","out.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is \n","being looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean, \n","it doesn't -- it's not necessarily material until you get to the \n","decision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of \n","different options.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  If it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out \n","now, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  When a guy says in February --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are \n","looking at the widest possible range of options.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  So something's changed.  They weren't looking at it \n","before; they're looking at it now.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know if the working \n","groups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide \n","net.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able \n","to sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now \n","are saying that, in fact, it is being considered?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are \n","looking at a wide range of options.  They have not --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly \n","ruled it out on several occasions in the past month?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't deny that -- I mean, those \n","are the President's words.  Those are very clear.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Subsequent to the President's words, do you deny \n","that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled \n","it out?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about the timing.  I \n","think what we did was refer back to the President's words and say \n","they stand.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  So don't they stand any longer?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five \n","years it was ruled out.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President \n","did say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate \n","track, and as I said, I don't believe --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Separate from the President?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe this has been \n","presented to the President.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Are they considering something that the President \n","--\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Has ruled out?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     has ruled out?  I mean, will the President \n","consider a VAT tax?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not \n","presented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of \n","options.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly \n","listen to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Can we put this another way?  In his answer in \n","Ohio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax \n","system.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it \n","might be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the \n","case, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm not sure exactly what \n","you're asking.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  He talked about the VAT in the context of a \n","restructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health \n","care, for example.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Or anything else.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Or anything else.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  It was always in the context of substituting for \n","other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Has that change, too?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is that still his view?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I haven't spoken about those \n","specific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the \n","working groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes, \n","they have.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Certainly we're looking at a VAT, she said.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility \n","of a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a \n","decision?  No, he has not.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What kind of a deal do you have when you've got the \n","President's appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his \n","ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line \n","reform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has \n","specifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then \n","goes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at?  Is the \n","President concerned about that sort of thing?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President's \n","concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal \n","possible.  He's concerned with making sure that they have the most \n","thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the \n","different alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with \n","something like that it's certainly something the President will \n","explain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those \n","lines.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What does it mean exactly, though, when the \n","President rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the \n","table later if a more persuasive argument is made?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just -- that's indisputably \n","true.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He \n","has not made a proposal.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What makes him open to it now when he wasn't open \n","to it before?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's certainly willing to listen to \n","the argument.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Was he willing to listen to the argument for a \n","short-term tax this year, and he wasn't willing to listen to it in \n","Chilicothe?  He's now open to it --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was \n","that it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not \n","something he was proposing, not something he was floating.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Not something he was considering.  Those are his \n","words -- \"It's not something that's now under consideration.  If we \n","start considering it, I'll tell you.\"  You're now acknowledging, are \n","you not, that it is under consideration and --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm acknowledging that the task \n","force has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the \n","President has not made a decision on it.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But the door is open for the President to \n","reconsider including this as part of --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are \n","looking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you know if they will make a presentation on \n","behalf of the VAT to him?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that.  I assume that \n","if -- I don't know what stage they are it in proposing.  I don't know \n","that they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they \n","should present to him.  I know this is something the working groups \n","are looking at.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you understand, George, that none of us are \n","asking these questions in context of a decision that the President \n","has made, only about what the President is considering?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am \n","acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a \n","VAT.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  And the President will consider it?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the \n","argument if it is presented to him.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Does that mean the President -- that working groups \n","think that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working \n","groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, can I ask you another question about \n","Bosnia?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  No, he wants us to stay on this.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Let's do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  No, he got out of that swamp.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  I think we've gotten the bottom line on that VAT.  \n","Reggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said \n","that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked \n","out -- quote -- \"We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the \n","arms embargo together with our allies.\"  That seems to go a bit \n","further than what you've just said --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just \n","said.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept \n","what Reggie --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that \n","this is something that's under consideration.  It is something he \n","will consider if the current actions don't bring the Serbs to the \n","table.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Isn't there some kind of timetable here?  \n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  There's \n","going to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  That's on sanctions, that's on tightening the \n","sanctions.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's right, that's sanctions.  \n","And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope \n","that that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr. \n","Bartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also \n","working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to \n","pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option \n","as well.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The question is whether there's a timetable for \n","consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo, \n","not the sanctions.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on \n","sanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting \n","the arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both \n","internally and with our allies.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the \n","U.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is \n","something that's under consideration, and this is something that we \n","take quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should \n","know the consequences of failing to come to the table.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Have they been given a deadline?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing \n","and it hasn't seemed to change the Serbs' behavior in the least.  Why \n","should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo \n","when so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the \n","fighting in Bosnia?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't accept the premise of \n","your question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an \n","effect.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What effect?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed \n","our warnings, then they will face the consequences.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What effect has it had in Bosnia?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on \n","the Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their \n","shipments through.  We can brief more fully --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it \n","had?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it's hard to say if it's \n","stopped the aggression to date.  That is why we're continuing to \n","press for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we \n","will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.  \n","I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn't \n","happened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can \n","weaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come \n","to the negotiating table, we'll move forward with the embargo.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Isn't there a working deadline, George, of the 24th \n","-- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  Hasn't the \n","United States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if \n","the Serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that \n","we'll seek -- haven't we said that we will seek --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We've said continually we're going \n","to --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But on that deadline?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have a specific date, but \n","we're going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution, \n","by around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails \n","to bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other \n","actions.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Isn't this awfully incremental?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're taking a step-by-step \n","approach.  We're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to \n","continue to do that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is there a possibility, George, that by the time \n","all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved \n","their goals and then what's the purpose?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the \n","Serbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many \n","different fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we're \n","pursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through \n","tightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms \n","embargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will \n","continue to do that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in \n","getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any \n","campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they've gained?  I mean, \n","once they're entrenched --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't speculate on that.  We're \n","going to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  We're \n","going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I can't \n","see into the future.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans \n","say they're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to \n","try and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which \n","show that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.  \n","What's your strategy to counter that?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one \n","we're going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up \n","the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package \n","will provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner \n","cities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point \n","out the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.  \n","We're going to point up the benefits of immunization.  We're going to \n","point up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the \n","Republicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or \n","they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Does it concern you, though, that the House now, \n","the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against \n","it before.  They made a mistake then; they're making a mistake now.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, does it strike anybody in the \n","administration that it's a bit strong to describe, as the President \n","did this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- \"a \n","reaffirmation of a promise of America\"?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it's the \n","promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full \n","potential. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Government-funded jobs?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?  \n","Absolutely.  That is the promise of America.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday \n","-- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at \n","it.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This \n","will be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus \n","package?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Where does that number come from?  Because we've \n","been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 \n","new jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something \n","like 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that's when \n","you do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will \n","receive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time \n","job effect, you have to do -- I don't know what the exact formula is.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  One to four because it's three months.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Can I follow up on that?  Did the President \n","misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money \n","for these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the \n","private sector?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think \n","that there will be grants available.  That's one of the ways that you \n","pay for the jobs.  At the same time, he's also issued a challenge to \n","the private sector to hire kids on their own as well.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to \n","work at Time-Warner?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually \n","somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  That's going to \n","be the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where \n","there would be grants to businesses.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Has the President spoken with any Senate \n","Republicans this week?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  \n","No, but there's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the \n","White House.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  At a lower level.  But the President hasn't?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Getting any closer to get the votes?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're continuing to work on it. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Anybody leaning your way?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting \n","something of a breakthrough in Aristide's attitude towards the coup \n","leaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what \n","impact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to \n","say yesterday in his report?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.  \n","I can't confirm what's actually happening in the talks.  I would \n","leave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has \n","returned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White \n","House from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time \n","again, we believe that assurances of security are important to a \n","final resolution to a broader political settlement.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, yesterday you offered some selective \n","breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.  \n","Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be \n","impacted?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states, \n","yes.  And I think we can get it out.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Could you make that generally available?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  And could you do it by the component of the \n","stimulus?  In other words --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if we can do -- I know \n","that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I don't know how \n","deeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into \n","summer jobs and other jobs.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  And can I follow up?  Is this the information that \n","Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the \n","states?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they're ads, but \n","they're press releases.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Can you describe what those press releases contain?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we're doing is pointing out the \n","benefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know \n","that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.  \n","And I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package \n","creates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New \n","Hampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that \n","this is important. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Where are the releases going?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  To whom?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  It's no problem.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Can we get it?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Why don't you put them out here as well?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  This afternoon?  Would that be possible?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to check.  I don't know.  \n","But as soon as we can.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Are you focusing these press releases on states \n","where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're trying to get as many \n","as we can.  It's actually quite difficult to pull this together and \n","we're doing our best.  We're putting them out as we get them.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole's \n","schedule?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Are press releases going along to states where he's \n","visiting?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure.  I think that \n","probably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?  \n","(Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, as the President goes about the business of \n","defending what's in his stimulus package, he doesn't address what \n","seems to be the Republicans' main point, that you're funding it with \n","deficit spending rather than \"if it's so important, why not come up \n","with the funding for it\" seems to be the Republican argument.  And \n","how do you answer that?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying \n","for it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this \n","package over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump-\n","start for jobs.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  You're not claiming, are you, that that doesn't add \n","to the deficit this year?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm saying we're paying for it over \n","time.  I didn't say that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  I know that, George.  But I mean, from the \n","beginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things --\n","deficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But \n","over time our budget fully pays for this program.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What you're saying is that there are savings that \n","would cover this if it were this year in future years?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  That's exactly what I \n","said.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  I know that, but there is going to be outstanding \n","debt, it will add to the national debt from this year --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we're reducing the deficit by \n","$500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  You mean you're reducing it below what it would \n","have been?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  In fact, you're adding a very large amount to the \n","national debt over the period of --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we're reducing it far more from \n","what it would have been.  That's true.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  You're getting to be a grumpy old man.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, has any decision been made about the White \n","House or the President's participation in the gay rights march coming \n","up in a week and a half?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on the President's \n","schedule now.  I believe he's going to be at the Senate Democratic \n","retreat in Jamestown that weekend.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Will he address it by phone?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about that.  It's a \n","little far out, but I believe he's going to be in the Senate retreat.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  So will he have the leaders in a day or two before \n","the speech?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I would expect that \n","at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups.  \n","I don't know the schedule on it, though.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in \n","conjunction with the event?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  April 22nd is Earth Day.  What is the President \n","going to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign \n","the biodiversity treaty that day?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know there's been some work on \n","the biodiversity treaty.  I don't know about signing it that day, but \n","I would expect he'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around \n","then.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to check with Katie \n","McGinty.  I just know that there's been some work done, but I don't \n","know exactly what.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  When is Earth Day?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The 22nd, I think.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Why is it you know that he is going to have a \n","statement on Earth Day but you don't know if he's going to have a \n","statement on the gay rights march?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I said I don't know if he's going \n","to meet or when he's going to meet.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you have a statement on the gay rights march?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't, actually, no.  I wouldn't \n","be surprised if he did, though.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a working visit on Friday and \n","the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of \n","issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and \n","the trade issues between the two countries.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  There was some expectations that a second aid \n","package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if \n","I understand, it hasn't happened.  Why is that or what's the status \n","on that?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The G-7 meeting is still going on \n","and, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked \n","about the outlines of a possible package.  But we're going to \n","continue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q?\t    We will not then make any kind of announcement \n","during the two-day meeting?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to look at that, but I \n","believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of \n","Tokyo.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, has there been further consideration here \n","about going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that there's -- it's \n","not something we've ruled out.  We don't have a date set for it.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, you all have a position or do you support \n","Immigration's plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United \n","States?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the first I've heard of it.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, there was a report today about the --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Fortunately.  (Laughter.) \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     about the pace of appointments and says that \n","President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions \n","that people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the \n","pace of nominations or where do you stand with it?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President's \n","appointments.  And it's broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147 \n","noncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  I'm not sure what that means --\n","(laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it's \n","about the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along \n","farther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a \n","multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect \n","the process to speed up.  But we're at the pace of Bush.  Obviously \n","we'd like to get these done as quickly as possible.  \n","\t     \n","\t     I would point out that the FBI background checks and the \n","background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time \n","than our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we're \n","working on it.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is that because of Nannygate?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's an awful big part of \n","it, yes.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  In the story this morning, you were at \n","approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way \n","behind in winning confirmations.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's where the background checks \n","comes into play.  That's the problem.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  That's the background checks problem?  Because I \n","mean, you have a Democratic Senate --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that's not the -- you make the \n","appointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all \n","the forms and have the background checks done.  That's exactly where \n","the problem is.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What's the President doing this afternoon, and \n","what's on the plan for tomorrow?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got some meetings -- just \n","office meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of \n","issues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues.  And then \n","he'll be -- tomorrow we'll have an event, probably again focused on \n","the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.  And \n","Friday is the Miyazawa meeting.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow, \n","George?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Either tomorrow or Friday.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the \n","Japanese Prime Minister's visit tomorrow?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about tomorrow, but \n","we'll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these \n","visits.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you \n","know what that was about?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was here.  He met with a group \n","of us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Who?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Reverend Jackson.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Reverend Jackson.  Mack McLarty, \n","me, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Talking about Haiti?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We talked about general urban \n","policy.  He is about to go to Los Angeles.  He was just back from \n","Mississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he's going \n","on to Los Angeles.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Did he request the meeting?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, no.  He's in continual \n","contact with the President.  He had written a letter on a variety of \n","issues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords \n","tonight in Vermont.  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at \n","all on this?\n","\n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's been some contact, \n","sure.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Can you tell us about the contacts?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure -- \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you know who contacted him or what was said?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that Howard Paster talked to \n","him and they just has a general talk about the package.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  And did he express his support for it now, or is he \n","--\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't divulge the details of the \n","conversation, but there have been conversations.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion --\n","elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care \n","package.  Is this something the President is considering?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Along with the VAT?  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's certainly something that's \n","been looked at, but no decisions have been made.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What was the question?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The L.A. Times story on whether \n","abortions will be covered by the President's health plan.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your \n","meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice \n","about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of \n","the verdict in L.A.?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we certainly talked about the \n","situation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic \n","development and other issues.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  For instance, did you discuss whether it would be \n","helpful for the President to go there or not?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we discussed a wide range of \n","issues related to Los Angeles.  That was certainly one of them.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in, \n","I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, good.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     your reaction to Margaret Thatcher's comments \n","that you're just sitting by and watching a massacre.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we've been pushing very hard \n","on a number of fronts for more aggressive action.  We will continue \n","to do that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Can you tell us if you've made any progress in your \n","talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise?  I mean, we don't \n","have any feel except talks are ongoing.  Have you talked to like 20 \n","people or --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the numbers.  We've \n","talked to several people and we've had wide-ranging sessions.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Anyone leaning your way?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't get into that.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk \n","with Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there \n","were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very \n","good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as \n","well.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe \n","Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not \n","speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the \n","President was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close \n","of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the \n","President about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked \n","about that yesterday afternoon.\n","\t     \n","\t     At the close of that discussion they said that they \n","would have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator \n","was up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific \n","compromises made on either side, they did say that they would \n","continue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are \n","both making concessions?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that \n","phase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said \n","consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  \n","He believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to \n","take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to \n","make those adjustments.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  On the subject of a VAT --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Can we stay on this for one more minute?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  We have a problem with the five minutes --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  I know no decisions have been made, but what would \n","lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go \n","down that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said \n","this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a \n","number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked \n","at.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been \n","made.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  To follow, have they done that directly through \n","him?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President \n","about it?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although \n","there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the \n","VAT.  But the President has not made a decision.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  At the meetings that he's had with his own task \n","force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the \n","possible options would be?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been \n","presented for a decision, no.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an \n","option?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of \n","briefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the \n","President as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  You're not saying he didn't know it was being \n","considered, though, are you?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  He knew that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But has he discussed that with his advisers?  \n","That's what I'm asking.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being \n","considered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been \n","over the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I \n","don't even know that it's --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at \n","this stage?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're \n","getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is \n","considered -- \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed \n","it.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just \n","repeated. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, is there any concern here that as a result \n","of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if \n","it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out \n","the way it did, that there may now be the development of a \n","credibility gap on this issue and others?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is \n","now public knowledge that this is being considered.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute \n","statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it \n","was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it \n","come out not from you people, but --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out \n","from the administration.  What are you talking about?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What I'm saying is, though, that the President said \n","he would let us know. \n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that \n","it's not going to be on the program.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  On March 25th. \n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out \n","by rooting around in the fine print of an interview\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do \n","a very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --\n","(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of \n","Health and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys \n","write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the \n","Clinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right \n","here, and AP story -- \"Clinton wants more money for spying.\"\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What about his remark that if it were being \n","considered, he'd tell us about it?  \n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned, \n","and he'd let you know.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  And did he?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say \n","this morning?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of \n","me.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of \n","Health of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his \n","administration.  That is his administration policy.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they \n","orchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they \n","answered the questions.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  You're saying here that it didn't have to be \n","dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were \n","considering it.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  \n","Painfully clear.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Was there a particular political strategy in making \n","it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax \n","day?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being \n","considered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they \n","answered that it was being considered.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, The New York Times --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Why do it yesterday?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The New York Times reports today that Secretary \n","Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and \n","oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures \n","in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill, \n","but which turned out to be totally false.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally \n","false, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor \n","Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they \n","say that. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The question is, is the President concerned about \n","behavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he \n","doing about it, if so?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a \n","mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the \n","matter.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Isn't that the same information that goes to the \n","President?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of \n","information.  I think that's where the confusion was.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  When did you all first learn about this mistake \n","that was made?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  And as far as you know, is the President aware of \n","it?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  And was he aware of it before he read about it in \n","The New York Times?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  \n","Anything?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on \n","this for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both \n","statements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that \n","mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said \n","it was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Did they drop it -- is this something that you \n","choose to spin or make an issue of?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of \n","work, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to \n","get this jobs package going.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a \n","minute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an \n","amendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment \n","would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in \n","the conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting \n","that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no \n","changes in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the \n","timing like that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer \n","this week than you were last week?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going \n","to pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make \n","adjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the \n","votes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's \n","going to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes \n","deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Has there been any indication that this situation \n","has changed?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on \n","it.  We'll know when the votes are taken.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, last week you said that there are -- or \n","various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go \n","through Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because \n","he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the \n","compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could \n","accept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've \n","realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted \n","to talk to the President about the stimulus package.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  He initiated the conversation?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, \n","the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You \n","say he's making --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly \n","what he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that \n","there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, \n","and the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President \n","doesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get \n","it through, he will.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was \n","working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before \n","the actual vote.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Today?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will \n","happen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward \n","with some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come \n","forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it \n","passed.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the \n","first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you \n","tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase \n","is.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?  \n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how \n","detailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the \n","package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday \n","afternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today \n","in the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator \n","Dole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific \n","compromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.  \n","And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that \n","we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What are the follow-up discussions if not the \n","President and Dole?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going \n","to talk to Senator Dole.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, \n","how about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the \n","President, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation \n","in that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Did they discuss actual numbers?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they \n","talked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked \n","about the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the \n","level of this many x-billion dollars. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a \n","package?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Did the White House have anything to do with the \n","protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole \n","was speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  And has the President been in touch with Senators \n","Kohl or Feingold?  \n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them, \n","no.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, is the President considering the more \n","palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the \n","haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going \n","to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves \n","having to pay for the have-nots?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that \n","the tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his \n","budget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your \n","question, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, \n","you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money \n","that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is \n","not true.  It's actually waste water money.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for \n","Wisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But it would not affect the drinking water problem \n","because it's waste water money, right?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment \n","overall. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But the implication from your statement the other \n","day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  \n","Would you agree that's not the case?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I \n","know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  A leftover question from this morning, which was, \n","when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating \n","on a VAT?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just \n","don't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between \n","the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.  \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  So sometime since March 25th?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know \n","the exact date.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, the President this morning mentioned that \n","some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the \n","National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax \n","being okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel \n","that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed, \n","or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already \n","proposed?  \n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to \n","say about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is \n","being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  \n","The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't \n","be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the \n","income tax, for instance?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on \n","that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, \n","Senator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you \n","think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it \n","have a chance?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is that a consideration whether you all put it \n","forward?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration \n","if the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration \n","now.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  You said at the beginning of the briefing that \n","circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under \n","consideration.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to \n","this morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something \n","that has to be considered.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  \n","That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled \n","it out that groups have asked it to be considered?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is that true?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin \n","taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the \n","deliberations.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But, George --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as \n","the President said, groups came forward and said this is something \n","you ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is that the only thing that's changed since his \n","prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Can you explain how those groups -- how that \n","information got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading \n","the newspaper or did groups make presentations?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, \n","the health care task force has met with dozens of groups.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But this is the President's knowledge that these \n","groups had come forward.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what \n","was coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been \n","published positions in the newspapers.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Have certain groups briefed him on the group's \n","presentations to them?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him \n","-- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the \n","working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these \n","groups.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What kind of arguments did the groups make that \n","were persuasive enough that the President would change the position \n","that he had enunciated previously?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had \n","longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance \n","health care.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The President wasn't aware of those longstanding \n","positions?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  \n","Obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the \n","basic arguments for and against a VAT tax.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What we're trying to figure out here -- you're \n","telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this \n","change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February \n","and now --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't \n","necessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  I know, but the President said that it was off the \n","table.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's \n","changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also \n","describing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.  \n","If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been \n","made to the President --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the \n","presentations to the health care task force.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  There's no relationship at all between the fact \n","that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he \n","favored will not produce enough revenue to finance --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested \n","that they would produce all the revenue.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were \n","appropriate ways to finance health care.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that \n","he said anything to refute that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that \n","there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind \n","of core benefits --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task \n","force ever suggested that there would.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break \n","his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his \n","programs?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical \n","situation.\n","\t     \t  \n","\t     Q\t  But does that promise -- would that promise not to \n","raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him \n","from seeking a VAT tax?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions \n","on the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the \n","implications then.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, \n","labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task \n","force has prompted this consideration?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just \n","don't have that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, can you tell us to what extend these other \n","alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or \n","other financing options are also still on the table and what these \n","options are?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force \n","and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking \n","at a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that \n","there are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not \n","going to comment --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What's the scope --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on \n","them, no.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What's the scope of the need?  How much are you \n","talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the \n","--\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task \n","force is looking at.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Since there's not going to be any briefing on the \n","Miyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the \n","President hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his \n","task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and \n","the remark about market access at the press conference?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Does no mean yes.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Yes and no.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the \n","Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question \n","about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when \n","he was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that \n","certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the \n","President.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and \n","the U.S. that we want to do something about.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he \n","suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in \n","terms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?  \n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state \n","our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit \n","very clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your \n","characterization of the Prime Minister's comments.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     that we need specific export targets, specific \n","numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with \n","Miyazawa?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad \n","discussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into \n","those specifics until after the meeting.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Why?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t   That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or \n","not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical \n","targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of \n","hopeless that this is going to change very much?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must \n","have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not \n","want to get into the specifics of how that would be done.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But does the President believe that their stimulus \n","package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants \n","to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister \n","Miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to \n","be some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary \n","Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do \n","more, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to \n","work with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to \n","press for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I \n","think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and \n","we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral \n","packages.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work \n","with all our allies to do as much as we can.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today \n","Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on \n","the Bosnia policy.  And he said, \"It's a rather emotional response.\"  \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  \n","House condone that kind of remark?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary \n","Christopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also \n","that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find \n","answers for. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  But that specific -- \"rather emotional response\" -- \n","specific term?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with \n","the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it \n","good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now \n","to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  To take stronger action, to take military action -- \n","air strikes, anything that can be done?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what \n","must be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as \n","you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms \n","embargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase \n","pressure at this time.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What is your response to the critics who would say \n","that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain \n","the presidency?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard \n","for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard \n","for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the \n","arms embargo.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen \n","getting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said \n","that military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that \n","change your thinking?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to \n","whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to \n","say.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions \n","and talking about the arms embargo.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She \n","said she would be able to provide some administration officials who \n","could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are \n","you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  That's exactly what she said.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But \n","what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of \n","evidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are \n","connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and \n","we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have \n","an effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, \n","what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact \n","effect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods \n","into Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What \n","kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't \n","know.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at \n","all, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be \n","released?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.  \n","And it will be probably later today.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is the President considering signing an executive \n","order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work \n","force as part of the gay rights march here next week?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal \n","for that at this time, not that I know of.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  It's something that the President promised during \n","the campaign that he would do.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't \n","think it's anything that's on his plate right now.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point \n","on this issue?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.  \n","I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian \n","community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of \n","different groups and communities.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you know if that's scheduled --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  It's a good thing you asked.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  How long --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  \n","(Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I \n","don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major \n","speech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but \n","I think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to \n","give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not \n","exactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like \n","that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of \n","the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific \n","timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under \n","discussion and something we've been working on.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Campaign finance reform?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you think it will be next week?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The biodiversity treaty is something you're working \n","on?  I missed the question.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.  \n","He asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know \n","anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working \n","on.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you know what organizations might be represented \n","in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out \n","of town on the day of the march?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate \n","meeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a \n","speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston \n","on Sunday, as he did last year.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you \n","on the question?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  On the gays.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the \n","President's schedule for the day, certainly.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q?\t    George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is \n","that Sunday?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one \n","day?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how \n","long the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't \n","know.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  You would have made the gay meeting public, right?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting \n","-- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you \n","about it.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the \n","first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --  \n","\n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in \n","the Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's \n","not, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     at the White House in the Bush administration \n","gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White \n","House had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make \n","sure --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do \n","anything like that.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Certainly not.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What marching orders did the President give to \n","General Vessey?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for \n","about half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was \n","he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will \n","obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.  \n","The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting \n","and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes \n","in our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's \n","response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look \n","into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on \n","remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to \n","military archives.  \n","\t     \n","\t     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the \n","activities of the joint commission and on the document.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis \n","at this stage?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's \n","also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the \n","Vietnamese.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  A number of Defense officials have been saying that \n","they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, \n","non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to \n","as Americans from time to time.  Do people -- \n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final \n","determination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we \n","have it, we'll make a judgment.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  I know you don't have any final determination, but \n","given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that \n","that's a likely possibility?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize \n","it in any way until the review is complete.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech \n","in Boston?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is the President going to have a press conference \n","tomorrow with Miyazawa?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.  \n","Yes, I expect, yes.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Was Toon in with Vessey?  \n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  He was in on the meeting?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  What was the question?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey, \n","and the answer is yes. \n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal \n","report this morning the President's distressed about some of his \n","press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I \n","think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied \n","that the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would \n","point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than \n","any of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  How many questions?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 \n","occasions.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  How many were while he was jogging?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very \n","good question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the \n","article also implied that these questions were only answered at \n","tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  \n","He's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval \n","Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to \n","questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Oval Office press conference -- when was that? \n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the --\n","East Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval \n","Office, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the \n","Roosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington \n","Press Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local \n","television anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The \n","Portland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. \n","He's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and \n","Connecticut --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Can you address the question of the attitude?  The \n","article implies that he doesn't --\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Did you really get blamed for that Post story?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The story is that you -- are you held responsible \n","for it.\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment \n","about this.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Are you denying that the President has shown \n","displeasure publicly?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the \n","discussions between the President and myself.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Did the President write that letter to Chris \n","Webber?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball \n","player?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  That is an authentic letter?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Since the President first talked about the VAT in \n","February, he said at the time that he thought there probably should \n","be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  \n","Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a \n","proposal he hasn't made.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, does the President have some agenda for \n","this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a \n","general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about \n","including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  The military issue?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Is he using this event to name the AIDS --\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  George, what specifically is the President doing to \n","prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had \n","general discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the \n","Trade Representative and others.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t     report yet?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report \n","referred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him \n","today.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  He was?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  Does he intend to use any of these instances that \n","--\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the \n","report's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press \n","hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.\n","\t     \n","\t     Q\t  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was \n","that there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he \n","feels that way?\n","\t     \n","\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the \n","record in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, \n","I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The \n","thrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the \n","President may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he \n","has the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent \n","history.\n","\n","\t     Q\t  Can we come up to your office?
